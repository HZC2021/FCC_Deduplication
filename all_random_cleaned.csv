1252,2118298,7918830,"The FCC needs to stand up for Internet users like me and keep the net neutrality rules that are already in effect. The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to give the ISP monopolies like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the vital privacy and access protections we fought for and just recently won. I'm afraid of a pay to play Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules mean that ISP monopolies can't block or slow users' access to certain web services or create Internet fast lanes by charging websites and online services more money to reach consumers faster. That's the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. The internet is the best mode of communication these days. It's both a way to meet like minded people and to share differing views. Our world should be connected as it is now. The limitations set by various governments, like China's, restrict freedom of speech, of information, and freedom of the press to share news stories with the public in a way that will be readily available to all. To kill net neutrality would be not only limiting, but damaging to people's entire lives. I am personally dependent on the internet to stay in contact with friends and the person I am in a long distance relationship with. To give ISPs the right to charge premiums on that would hurt my ability to maintain these friendships. Certain political movements could also be slowed if ISPs decide their websites are unsavory content that they don't want to readily give people access to without extra payments. There are too many ways in which this could be used to take advantage of people. In the state of the world and the economy as it is, no one can afford the drastic and harmful changes that the removal of net neutrality would bring. No one save for the lobbyists who are literally using bots in an attempt to silence the voices of real people who truly do not want this.

For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation.

Additionally, these rules will allow ISPs to decide what people can or can't do or look at online. This is a very clear infringement on free speech in that it will allow ISPs to limit what I can say, who I can talk to, and what I can see. It is absolutely unacceptable to allow a small section of corporations to make rules on such things. The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard. As someone who does run multiple blogs that exist solely to share ideas and opinions, this may make it impossible for me to continue to enjoy these things as I have done for years. We live in a world where the internet is necessary and is a representation of true freedom of speech and ideas. To limit that in any way, outside of activities which break the law, would be simply unconstitutional and against the values the United States was build on.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government subsidized ISP monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the necessary access and privacy rules we fought for and won just two years ago. I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules ensure that ISP monopolies can't block or slow Internet users' ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach consumers faster. That's exactly the right balance to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits small businesses and consumers as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That's not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. The Internet matters to me because as a researcher, I need the ability to use the open Internet to gather information that I need to do my job.

I am a recent graduate of University of Kansas School of Business and have been working in the Audit industry for over 3 years. The biggest asset in both my academic life and my professional life has been my open access to the Internet. The open internet which was protected by the previous Net Neutrality laws have also increased my trust in our e commerce. Consumers should have equal access to all services and products provided on the Internet; options shouldn't be limited or intentionally manipulated. For these reasons and more, I OPPOSE the Chairman's proposal to reverse net neutrality protections and do not agree that the access to services and businesses on the internet should be at the discretion of Internet Service Providers ISPs . My constant use of the internet in college has fine tuned my ability to research subjects and problem solve in new ways. As a Business student, many of our projects focused on innovation and the benefits of equal opportunity in the market place. Time after time the students and I came across innovative entrepreneurs who benefited from Net Neutrality laws Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. . Handing the power to dictate the internet traffic flow would not have benefited these companies. Netflix is an example of innovation in the Video Rental market which then spurred their competitor, Hulu. My favorite part of this example is how Amazon adapted their existing infrastructure to make their mark in the video streaming market as well. I continue to use the internet to research subjects relevant to my job. As an IT Auditor I come across products, vendors, SEC Regulations that are relevant to the execution of a Financial Audit. I depend on having access to the best search engine when I access the internet and I place a certain amount of trust in the choices I make. A recent example of this is the litigation Google is facing by the EU. Google was found to be intentionally manipulate the results of consumer searches which in turn limited the choices a consumer had in the internet marketplace. This has decreased my trust in Google as a provided of fair search results. The same concept applies here with ISPs and my trust in the open internet.

The idea and thought that the absence of regulation would be equal or just as effective as the presence of regulation regarding net neutrality is insanely naive and horrifically incorrect. The very nature of a capitalistic system and the countless examples witnessed over decades show that corporations will do whatever it can do to maximize profits with complete disregard for the greater good or its effects on its customers. Strong net neutrality is protecting the right for all Americans to access whatever content they want on the Internet, without any influence from external companies or corporations and with fair competition.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the government subsidized ISP monopolies like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the necessary access and privacy rules we demanded and won just two years ago. I'm afraid of a pay to play Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules mean that ISPs can't block or slow Internet users' access to certain web services or create Internet fast lanes by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster.

2940,1955523,7635144,"Chairman Pai's proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine. As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections. Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai's pay to play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families. Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans. My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

The companies providing that access also provide telephone and Tv services which compete with similar services provided by online companies. It is unconscionable for a government agency to give a few companies such control over a market that they can cut off access to their competitors to achieve a monopoly.

To our small business, the increased cost and overhead of Internet services would be a huge detriment. Internet providers already nearly have a monopoly on certain market in the area where I live, for example, there are really only one or two options for high speed Internet service. From the time of the railroads, monopolies have always used their power to enrich themselves, and given precedence to their own interests. ISPs have become a type of common carrier of our digital information. One of the benefits of this is that they are not responsible for the information they transmit so they can't be prosecuted for the transmission of illicit materials, for example , but in exchange the government has always had the responsibility of making sure that they give everyone a level playing field by treating all traffic equally. I don't understand why a government agency, charged with regulating interstate and international communications, would consider stripping the rules that lubricate the continued transmission of information. I hope you will consider keeping rules in place that support net neutrality, requiring all traffic on the Internet to be treated equally. In fact, I hope that you will go beyond that and support bringing the United States into the modern era of communications by encouraging or requiring high speed optical cable from our companies, something common in South Korea and other highly developed nations, as well as other improvements to our infrastructure and current system.

2104,2091966,7859178,"I have been a computer and Internet user for most of my life, beginning in 1993 using a 486 computer over dial up access. The internet opened doors and gave me access to information and media far beyond the library and my teachers, which increased my knowledge and understanding of the world outside of the United States. When ADSL was offered in Atlanta we were early adopters, suffering a six month back and forth with AT&T. We re wired our home and purchased very expensive equipment, all for the sake of greater access to a vast and diverse collection of information and media of my choosing. I have watched cable media companies, such as Time Warner, Cox and Comcast enter into the ISP business, which has traditionally been the realm of telecom companies. At the same time, telecom companies such as Verizon and AT&T have entered into the media distribution fields. Both the telecom and the cable media industries are finding their traditional products less and less appealing as people move to a more consumer oriented model of media consumption and communication. On the media side I am referring to YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and the many similar products that allow consumers to choose what to watch and when from a nearly limitless catalog. On the telecom side the advent of VOIP has nearly eliminated the need for business phone lines, due to the tremendous cost savings over traditional ISDN and T1 phone service. individuals have opted for mobile phones, which is outside the scope of this proceeding but a pressure on the telecoms companies traditional business as well. The telecoms and cable media companies share a common product, internet access, which allow consumers to move away from their traditional offerings. This common product, internet service, is what the consumer wishes to purchase and use. The current model is to sell a tier of service based on bandwidth which the customer may use at will for any purpose, within the law. I fail to see any benefit to the customer in allowing the largest ISPs in the country to intentionally degrade service to customers. It absolutely allows an ISP to charge customers or providers more so that a certain service works correctly, or to drive customers to consuming media owned and monetized by the ISP most of whom are also content companies . That sounds like the classic organized crime racket of protection money . The claim that throttling online media services reduces network congestion is also a spurious one. If there is not enough available bandwidth on their networks an investment needs to be made, or suffer the consequences of a competitor who is willing to provide a superior product entering the marketplace. In closing, I urge the FCC to leave the 2015 ruling in place. The current ruling is most in line with our market economy as it fosters competition and requires ISPs to compete for customer business based on performance. Furthermore I take exception to anyone, other than myself, determining what is most important to me.",-1.0,0

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to hand the government subsidized telecom giants like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful privacy and access protections we fought for and just recently won. I'm worried about creating a tiered Internet with fast lanes for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online.

Chairman Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That's contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. If net neutrality is defeated, fast lanes can't be created. Rather, some websites, chosen by the few ISPs which exist, will provide lanes to their chosen sites which have the same speed as prior to net neutrality. Those sites outside the fast lanes will instead be throttled, creating a tiered, privileged system of website access which does nothing to better anyone's experiences of the internet.

2250,2424809,10088187,"I am writing to express my objections to roll back decisions and rules that currently regulate broadband internet providers as public utilities. The proposed alternative, to re classify ISPs as private mobile networks and regulate them through the light touch framework, will not significantly increase infrastructure investment and certainly will not improve innovation and choice. Nor would it substantially benefit consumers and the marketplace, except for the large communication monopolies. The communication companies have written and supported the government rules that guarantee them a field of play that is the antithesis of free market capitalism, little competition and restricting the public's access to information. I believe that the discussion should focus on 1 equality and freedom consistent with the republic's democratic goals and 2 promoting of innovation that will drive our economy and society forward. Information is knowledge and equal access to information is essential. Internet access plays a fundamental role in the nation's equality. We spend increasingly more of our commercial, political and social lives online, and our communications can reach across the world in microseconds. Our governments use the Internet and social media to manage civic affairs. We communicate with our government through the Internet. When one's access is restricted, their role is restricted; their ability to participate in our society is restricted. This is why open Internet matters. It's as essential to modern life as electricity and water. I believe that this country supports equality, not a digital version of separate but equal where citizens are able to participate only depending on their wealth. The Internet's story is a story of innovation. We have Google, Facebook, and Amazon exactly because there was a level playing field. Protecting the ISPs should not be the focus of our public policy. What we need are policies that protect the companies that haven't been invented or even imagined by letting them have a genuinely level playing field. Equality promotes innovation! The FCC needs to ensure that money won't drown out other voices. Our policies need to be rooted in the ideas of freedom and fair competition. The FCC needs to preserve both freedom and equality, where there are not any fast or slow lanes on the Internet and where all traffic flows freely. Everyone individuals, groups, large firms, tiny start ups must be treated the same way. Please make do not adopt the proposed rules of Restoring Internet Freedom because they do anything but restore freedom. Instead keep the exiting rules in place and continue to regulate ISPs as public utilities. Credit to Alberto Ibargüen of KnightFoundation.org.

346,387347,1096801,"As an Internet user, I'm asking the FCC to protect the net neutrality protections currently in place. The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet fast lanes by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me. Sincerely, Kendra Davis",1.0,1
