The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the ISP monopolies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping consumers of the necessary privacy and access protections we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations mean that Internet providers can’t slow or block users’ access to certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That’s the best way forward to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression.

The internet is one of the greatest accomplishments of the human race in recent years, and it's due in very large part to how open and free it is- all of human knowledge, available at anyone's fingertips with just a quick search.
That would change if Net Neutrality were to be abolished, and the internet would become a case of the few already popular websites being the only ones to ever feasibly continue to exist. New websites would have to pay a fee to bypass being slowed, and users would have to pay a fee just to use them- who wants to take that risk?
So, new websites would only be started by businesses that can swallow the cost. No new websites like Facebook, say, that were started by single people with some spare time.

This freedom comes with it's faults sure , nothing is perfect but to restrict it in this way will not only cause there to be too much control on my privacy and access to services. But it also will allow other countries that are not restricted in the way to be more innovative which will in turn lead to the US falling behind in what is already an very agressive technology space. The internet and the data  and access to services that it provides are not going away and if we stifle innovators potential here there we will end up paying for it in the long run as we are no longer able to adequately compete on the world stage.

217,3956,10979,"The FCC Open Internet Rules (net neutrality rules) are extremely important to me. I urge you to protect them.

Most Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:

* Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""
* Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)
* Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")

They're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.

I'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.

To my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.

To the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.

To my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination. 

I would be happy to speak more with anyone on your staff about the rules and why they’re so important to me. Please notify me of any opportunities to meet with you or your staff.

The internet is important to a myriad of people, including me, for reasons beyond words. We come to the internet for reliable news, for information, for the freedom to express our opinions and to speak our minds with the anonymity that the internet provides us. Ceasing to maintain net neutrality no longer provides us these freedoms unless the websites we use pay extra and also allows for cable companies to control what we do and do not see on the internet, which makes it a freedom of speech and expression issue. The fact remains that whether or not a website or organization is able to pay to stay in the ""fast lane"" should not determine how fast cable companies allow for them to load.

A level platform for me, you and everyone in third world countries.  Everyone deserves the same chance at being heard,  access to websites, services as anyone else.  
We all pay different prices to get on and use the net, but once you are on you are a citizen like anyone else.  I understand there is some nuance but keeping the internet as fair as possible is important .   Once we start making changes at the highest levels, it's a slippery slope toward a world which is less fair, stifle business and omitting people.

I am retired, have a medical condition that limits my ability to move about, and I am a person who needs and loves to be informed.  I am very, very, very disappointed with the FCC and the SEC allowing our society to become more and more monopolistic in nature . The internet  allows me to get varying points of view without having to pay the major cable providers and cellular providers like Sprint, Comcast, and ATT  REPEATING what each other is saying. Also having to listen to the WAY TOO MANY COMMERCIALS, and being double billed for service such as Com ast charging a broadcast fee in addition to an Internet fee that keeps rising each year, and they bill for programming that you don't want without providing additional channels beyond those already included in your package.

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that ISPs can’t block or slow customers’ access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet as it is now allows for an open exchange of information between individuals, groups, states, countries, and nations across the world. It's the closest thing to a level playing field we can get in terms of free basic education and specialization for everyone. Since their's no tier system currently in place, everyone can access the same information at roughly the same time, which encourages the sharing and development of ideas, which in turn improves societies as a whole.

Like most Americans, our family lives in a neighborhood where we have only one internet provider (Comcast).  Over recent years, this provider has selectively upgraded capabilities related to downloading content (for which they get additional profits through deals with major content providers) but upload speeds (which I need for work and cloud services) remain where they were a decade ago.  I can watch cat videos at reasonable speed, but I can't work remotely.  Without net neutrality, even the fig leaf of equal download speeds for all content providers will go away.  This will make my connection far more valuable for Comcast, and less valuable for me, my family and my employer.

Like many communities, the IP monopoly is maintained by overwhelming resources which are used to crush any competitor, and push through local contracts that guarantee exclusive access to utility poles.  We will always have a monopoly in our city.  Any economist will tell you that market forces are meaningless in a monopoly situation, particularly where demand is inelastic (in this case, required for modern life).  At the very least, that monopoly needs to be strongly regulated in the interest of the country as a whole.

It seriously concerns me that a group with your level of education and qualification would deny that Net Neutrality is required for a free an open internet. I'm sure you're well aware that Net Neutrality prevents anti-consumer behavior in corporations such as Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, Cox, and AT&T. Title II stops these entities from establishing data throttling practices like slowing popular streaming services and search engines. Because of Net Neutrality I, the average citizen, benefit while browsing the web or beginning a business venture. The Internet's abilitiy to disrupt established markets threatens cable providers. These providers coincidentally appear as the only benefactors from the new ""Restoring Internet Freedom act."" Like many others, I know why the FCC wants to ""restore internet freedom"" and it's not because you want people like me to benefit. Instead you act in tandem with whatever large companies line your pockets, even if your actions will completely upend all internet services. 
As a fellow American, I find it appalling that the FCC is so willing to compromise first amendment rights over whatever fat paychecks the lobbyists send you. Let me remind you that your job as the Federal Communications Commission is to protect the communications rights of all your citizens, not just those with billions of dollars. while I don't possess the same resources as the cable giants I hope you'll listen to an informed citizen
Whether you want to acknowledge it or not, ISPs are a utility provider, they're like my water company. ISPs built an infrastructure and unless there are two competing ISPs in an area people can only choose to have internet access or not. The now an integral part of modern life that the United Nations declared internet access a basic human right. If that isn't enough proof of ISPs' utility status than I hope you remember when the Kansas Cable Telecommunications Association lobbied for a bill in Kansas to stifle Google Fiber in 2014. a lobby that COX, Comcast, and Time-Warner all belong to. It doesn't take much cognitive process to see that ISPs strive for infrastructure monopoly like any other utility. 
So far I hope you've noticed, I have refrained from cursing you out. no more. In short, get your shit together you asshats. I'm not some fucking robot I'm a real person. If you'd like to come meet me I'd love to give you the bird in person. scumbags.

I'm concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites, because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that Internet providers can't slow or block our ability to see certain websites or create Internet ""fast lanes"" by charging websites and online service money to reach customers faster. That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast the authority to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the necessary access and privacy protections we demanded and just recently won. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that ISP monopolies can’t slow or block our ability to see certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai’s proposal would transform Internet providers into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new expression and innovation. That’s not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.

Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

The internet is the best mode of communication these days. It's both a way to meet like-minded people and to share differing views. Our world should be connected as it is now. The limitations set by various governments, like China's, restrict freedom of speech, of information, and freedom of the press to share news stories with the public in a way that will be readily available to all. To kill net neutrality would be not only limiting, but damaging to people's entire lives.

I am personally dependent on the internet to stay in contact with friends and the person I am in a long distance relationship with. To give ISPs the right to charge premiums on that would hurt my ability to maintain these friendships.

Certain political movements could also be slowed if ISPs decide their websites are ""unsavory content"" that they don't want to readily give people access to without extra payments. There are too many ways in which this could be used to take advantage of people. In the state of the world and the economy as it is, no one can afford the drastic and harmful changes that the removal of net neutrality would bring. No one save for the lobbyists who are literally using bots in an attempt to silence the voices of real people who truly do not want this.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the government-subsidized ISP monopolies like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast the authority to throttle whatever they please, stripping consumers of the meaningful access and privacy safeguards we demanded and just recently won. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules mean that ISPs can’t slow or block our access to certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach consumers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

I'm sending a message to you in order to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title 2 in place.  Without these rules, we may lose the internet as it is now. The changes proposed to FCC rules would allow faster lanes for sites that pay, while those who cannot pay  are stuck in the slow lanes. We've already seen access to streaming services such as Netflix, Soundcloud, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even bloked. Conditions like these greatly impact large and small businesses ina bad way, and penalizes users who patronize them. These hanges also open up doors to unfair taxation on internet users, and could make it difficult for blogs, nonprofit artists, and others who can't pay to have their voices heard. Paragraph 82 asks for input on whether throttling should be regulated. In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had forced to stop in the courts. Isn't it possible they could do this again? I am also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is ""unlimited,"" but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren't part of their approved zero-rating network. Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title 2 in place.

I will use '//' to indicate what is supposed to be a new paragraph, and I suggest you copy paste this into notepad and hit enter where they are, to make for easier reading. I promise, it's really not as daunting as it looks. 
   //   
My name is Maegan. I am 21 years old. When I was 7, I developed an autoimmune disease that started to destroy my motor neurons, starting in my feet and hands and moving up. Doctors were able to stop it, but it had already paralyzed me for the most part. During the worst of it, as a small, 7 year old girl, I couldn't roll myself over in bed. I had a baby monitor in my room so I could call to my parents when I was uncomfortable and need to readjust. 
   //   
Thankfully, I was lucky, and with treatment I eventually started to recover. Now, 14 years later, I am able to walk completely unassisted (albeit with foot drop), and run, though only a little at a time. Part of the reason I'm still is weak is that in the wake of the autoimmune disease, I developed autonomic disorders. 
   //   
Generally, I can only do one or two active things in one day, and certainly not more than two days in a row. Even being active two days in a row will wipe me out. My body is marked with various scars from past surgeries, but they don't really bother me; more so is that my extremities are often pale and/or purple, or blotchy, because I don't have a high enough blood pressure to get the blood everywhere it needs to go. This means I can't even sit cross legged without my legs going painfully numb within a few minutes. If I have more than one household chore to do, I have to take at least an hour break between them, or I will become nauseated. In fact, even if I haven't done anything at all I will become nauseated, or have abdominal pain. I get sick a lot. 
   //   
Despite all this, I'd like to say I have a fairly positive attitude. One of the main reasons for this, I think, is the technology I have available to help cope with my less-than-preferable lifestyle. Much of this technology requires using the internet. 
When I feel especially sick, I will zone out watching Netflix or YouTube, and it will help take my mind off it. I always watch movies or listen to podcasts while I cross stitch, which helps me to maintain dexterity and practice working with my fingers, even though my hands will never not shake. I have various social networks which I have used to find support groups for those with similar health problems as me, which is particularly important seeing as with the rarity of many of my problems, the people I connect with in these groups are far away; there's no other way I'd be able to be a part of that community. Much of my scheduling and communication with my doctors occurs online. And one of my favorite past times is online gaming, where I often find so much support, and a surprising amount of others in similar situations to mine. 
   //   
I think we like these games because they allow us to be and do what we never will. It's not just an issue of not being in the right environment, like a fantasy world or something; it's that even if I was there, as I am, I wouldn't be able to run around, wielding a sword, dodging things and helping people and being a hero. (In fact, in many of these games, were I there as I am, I would be long dead, not from incompetence but just lack of medical attention.) Personally, my heart swells when I watch nearly any type of dancing. I love music, and the feeling of being a part of it through dance, even though it's vicarious for me, is wonderful. But it also almost always makes me cry. In games, I can translate mental skill and practice into physical feats and important deeds of all sorts. 
   //   
When it comes to things that help me, just generally ""the internet"" isn't what immediately comes to mind. But almost everything I do think of involves it in some way, from gaming, to my various support groups. And that's not even to mention school. My fatigue makes attending classes extremely difficult. And although it's taking me more than 4 years, I'm still on my way to a computer science degree. One of the ways I'm able to do this is through online classes, and online communication that helps me catch up on material I sometimes have to miss. But more than that, the internet lets me learn freely. I've often said, if I could make a living just learning, that'd be wonderful. Unfortunately, the resources I have available to me in person, though plentiful, are often lacking. No matter who I talk to, it seems only a third of professors people encounter are actually decent, and only for maybe 10% of them are students actually like, ""wow, I'm really lucky to have this professor."" It doesn't help that professors only need to know their subject matter... rarely have they ever been taught how to teach it. (And even that can't be relied upon... I have had multiple TA's literally tell me to 'google it'.) This coming fall, I have to take multivariable calculus. Normally, I would be dreading it, except that with Khan Academy, I've been learning it myself over the summer, and it turns out I love it! Because I was able to seek out and find a type of instruction that worked and made sense for me, and then learn it my own way, I'm able to actually *enjoy* math. Which, as far as I know, is not something many people often say. With things like Khan Academy and YouTube and MIT open courses, not only can I make up for where my professors lack, but I can learn about topics that wouldn't otherwise be worth my time and money to actually sign up for a poor quality class for. While my degree may be computer science, I've watched entire series of topics from ""crash course"" on youtube, particularly Crash Course in World History, where they try to give an overview of history, but while being reasonably thorough, and as objective as possible. But the reason I started watching it, and kept watching it, was because they also made it entertaining. Both of these are things that anyone with open internet access is able to avail themselves of. 
   //   
As far as legal things go... I have Comcast. Living where I do, I do not have the option to choose a different ISP. When they have advertised their services, they have advertised various things you can do with the internet, sure, but they by no means even suggest that these are the only services they are providing access to. We are paying for, and expect, equal access to the internet as a whole.
   //   
Net neutrality is important to me. It's important to my daily life and everything I am. It's important to everyone I know. It's something that I would expect an organization like FCC to protect. It's something I *need* them to protect. 
   //

A couple of decades ago, I told my sister that the time would come that if we failed to find something on the internet, we would believe that it didn't exist.  In fact, we've arrived at the point that many of us obtain more news online than via TV or newspapers, and paper media have had to transition to an online presence in order to survive.  Facebook and other forums are able to give us the news that we want to hear instead of all the news, which causes people to receive news & information that coincide with and reinforce their current opinions and beliefs without them realizing that they have been placed in a self-reinforcing information bubble.  This has lead to a deep political schism in our country which is putting our Democracy at risk.  Currently, this phenomenon is still mitigated by the fact that people can search for and find additional information, points of view, etc., on the internet.  If ISPs allow information exchange to be faster or slower based on who can afford to pay the most, that further skews the information that people can find and access on the internet.  Media conglomeration and the switch to profitable ""infotainment"" already controls and limits much of what we see on TV, but on the internet I can still find international news, reports of an event from multiple sources, follow references online to assess the quality of the reporting, etc.  There is also a wealth of independent media that has developed to provide more information and perspective that the TV media are not covering while their entire focus is on the current daily round of presidental crises. If we allow ISPs to provide faster access and response times to those who can pay for it, then independent media will essentially be choked out of the market and the ""news"" will  serve and belong exclusively to whomever has the deepest pockets.  This will violate the letter and spirit of the First Amendment; a free and open press is the foundation of our Democracy. If we lose net neutrality, we will surely lose what remains of independent media, and surely will become a DINO - Democracy In Name Only.

1661,1682704,6018266,"I’m calling on the FCC to stand up for net neutrality and safeguard Title II protections. 

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T the legal cover to create Internet fast lanes, stripping users of the meaningful access and privacy rules we worked for and won just two years ago. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations mean that ISPs can’t slow or block our access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services more money to reach people faster. That’s the best way forward to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposal would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet is a crucial part of my social life, as I have friends and family all over the U.S. and the world. Keeping in touch with them regularly is highly important to me, and the possibility that a service provider could decide they don't like the websites or apps we use to contact each other is repugnant.

I also use the internet for a great deal of research for writing, and letting ISPs place value on what information is available is the path to ruin. Freedom of information is necessary for education, innovation, and remaining a competitive global power.

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because the proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked.

Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules mean that Internet providers can’t slow or block users’ ability to see certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster. That’s the right kind of forward-looking approach to make sure competition in the Internet space is fair and benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies.

We will boycott any company that dares trample upon our freedoms, and we will expose their greed to the world. This does not end until the internet is safe from the greed of internet service providers and the politicians they’ve bought. You are about to go to war with the internet, and it is a war you will lose. 

I am unconcerned with your personal beliefs on the matter. The public is watching, and we will not hold back. One of two things is going to happen at the vote: either the people will begin fixing a broken system, or the system won’t be broken.",1.0

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the telecom giants like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping consumers of the necessary access and privacy protections we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current net neutrality rules ensure that ISPs can’t block or slow customers’ access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging websites and online services money to reach consumers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as larger players. Pai’s proposal would help turn ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That’s not how the Internet was built, and that's not what we want. 

The internet is one of the few truly free mediums for acquiring and sharing knowledge, ideas, and the innovations of the future. Any manner of restriction, for profit or for personal motives of those behind those ISPs, is a direct debilitation of that potential that weakens the future of our global world for the short-sighted good of a very select minority.

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to hand the telecom giants like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T free rein to throttle whatever they please, stripping users of the meaningful access and privacy protections we fought for and just recently won. 

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that ISPs can’t slow or block consumers’ ability to see certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services more money to reach customers faster. That’s the right kind of forward-looking approach to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits consumers and small businesses as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would transform Internet providers into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built.

Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can’t block or slow our ability to see certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach people faster.

Chairman Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

The internet is an open forum in which media, news, and information is spread and easily accessible to the public. If ISPs were able to implement fast and slow lanes and even block sites, they would hinder the ability of  information to move and spread. While they could choose to keep ever site available, sites could be behind such a high pay wall that those who are disadvantaged that those sites would never be accessible. Finally, this would not be isolated to the US. Many ISPs work beyond our country and this practice would spread worldwide if net neutrality is abolished.  This is a poor practice that does not benefit the general public as a whole and would set the premise for internet censorship.

That's exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as larger players. Pai's proposed repeal of the rules would transform ISPs into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That's not the kind of Internet we want to pass on to future generations of technology users. 

I urge you to keep Title II net neutrality in place, and safeguard Internet users like me.

I’m worried about creating a tiered Internet with “fast lanes” for certain sites or services because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current Open Internet rules ensure that ISP monopolies can’t block or slow customers’ ability to see certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites money to reach customers faster.

This could severely impact my business. My ISP could determine that they don't agree with our company's core values; or what if my ISP becomes a competitor for the type of content I provide? My ISP could control what I see and hear on the internet. That is wrong! 

The internet is a place where I can access the whole of the world, good and bad, and make my own choices. Yes, there has to be limits on hate speech, exploitation and criminal acts, but if the internet becomes crippled by the loss of net neutrality, our country will fall in stature, and become more like a Russia or a China, countries where they control their citizen's access to the internet.

That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

The Internet is a place where people are able to speak their views, start businesses, and receive an education. By placing restrictions on the Internet, everyday individuals would be denied their rights to freedom of speech, and small businesses could potentially be beat out by large corporations and be forced to shut down. And, with slowed internet speeds, children and adults would both be hindered in seeking an education, which is necessary to survive in our society.

I use the Internet in my work as a scientist, searching through relevant literature so that I stay up to date and know what has already been done on research questions that I'm interested in.

I use it to schedule appointments with my doctor, to read new science fiction and fantasy stories, to study languages. I use it to search for and apply for jobs. 

I volunteered for years for a rape crisis hotline that is Internet-based, using a messaging platform. The hotline had specific programs to serve military servicemembers/families and Peace Corps volunteers who needed rape crisis services, and was important for people who couldn't talk over the phone because of privacy issues, lack of access to international calling, or other reasons. Such hotlines are becoming increasingly common; I know that they exist for LGBTQ youth in crisis among others. do you want to risk the people who need those hotlines having inferior access to those sites?

The FCC should throw out Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the government-subsidized telecom giants like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T free rein to throttle whatever they please, stripping consumers of the meaningful privacy and access protections we fought for and won just two years ago. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing FCC regulations ensure that ISPs can’t block or slow consumers’ access to certain web services or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach customers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and consumers as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would help turn Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with the ability to veto new innovation and expression. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

I began using the Internet back in the days when there were only a very small number of institutions connected to it.  I've seen it grow and expand to what it is today.  That could not have happened the way it did if it hadn't been left alone.  The original charter of the Federal Government and its agencies, according to the Constitution, is to protect rights that people already have, it should not presume to determine what those rights are.  The Internet is what it is today because it was largely left alone.  The Internet was neutral when it started growing and it should remain that way.  It is the FCC's job to PROTECT that neutrality.  DO NOT allow private businesses to determine just what they will and will not provide access to.  PROTECT the neutrality of the Internet!

When I was in middle school (2006) I did not have internet access let alone a functioning computer. My school work would be done at school or at a public library where there is a limit to how long you are able to use it. This is still a common occurrence with some teenagers. The addition of the slow or fast lane would not allow much time to do anything, the Orange Public Library allows a max of 1hr and 15minutes. This is the most practical purpose as institutions such as libraries and schools do not have the sufficient budget to pay a premium for internet access. The idea of both small and big businesses have an even playing field, cable companies already have a monopoly in how we access the internet I do not want to give them more control of how I wish to view web page content.

I’m afraid of a “pay-to-play” Internet where ISPs can charge more for certain websites because ISPs could have too much power to determine what I can do online. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations mean that Internet providers can’t slow or block customers’ access to certain websites or engage in data discrimination by charging online services and websites money to reach people faster.

That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules will hurt businesses by allowing companies to pay more in order to make their lanes faster, but also their competitors slower. Internet business, which is huge and growing every day, will no longer be able to stay stable. Even large corporations like Amazon disagree with these rules.

Additionally, these rules will allow ISPs to decide what people can or cannot do or look at online. This is a very clear infringement on free speech in that it will allow ISPs to limit what I can say, who I can talk to, and what I can see. It is absolutely unacceptable to allow a small section of corporations to make rules on such things.

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard. As someone who does run multiple blogs that exist solely to share ideas and opinions, this may make it impossible for me to continue to enjoy these things as I have done for years.

We live in a world where the internet is necessary and is a representation of true freedom of speech and ideas. To limit that in any way, outside of activities which break the law, would be simply unconstitutional and against the values the United States was build on.

2569,2906966,19271669,"I'm a Software QA Engineer and web developer. Like many people in these fields, I frequently work remotely. Fast, reliable, unrestricted internet is absolutely crucial to my livelyhood.

Despite living in the heart of Silicon Valley, I have exactly one option for high-speed internet. In fact, I can honestly say that never in my life have I lived anywhere where there were multiple reasonable options for broadband. Typically there is a single high-speed cable provider, and usually a vastly slower and more expensive DSL provider.

Given this utterly uncompetitive environment, I am extremely concerned that the FCC's attempts to revoke net neutrality protections for consumers will result in a lower, more restricted quality of service.

First, I strongly dispute the notion that ISPs can be classified as ""information services."" When I go to buy internet service, I'm interested in only one thing: a fast, ""dumb"" pipe to the internet that I can use to access the websites and services I choose. I have zero interest in any other offerings an ISP may have. I expect my ISP to provide the pipe, and nothing else. This seems to be a textbook fit for the definition of ""telecommunications service.""

In an environment without competition and without net neutrality, I am gravely concerned about the following:

My ISP blocking or degrading access to services that do not pay for a ""fast lane"" to customers.
-----------------------------
There is no good reason for this ever to be something ISPs are allowed to do. If an ISP is already providing a consistently high quality of service, there is no reason for anyone to pay for a fast lane. Allowing the owners of internet-based services to pay for prioritized access creates a strong financial incentive to degrade non-paying services to the point where a customer has a bad experience.

In fact, I have already personally experienced exactly this sort of service degradation. For a period of more than six months, Comcast and Netflix were engaged in a dispute about whether Netflix should be required to pay interconnection fees to Comcast in order to deliver content to Comcast customers. When Netflix refused to pay, Comcast simply declined to upgrade the interconnects to handle the volume of traffic being sent. During this time, the Netflix service which I paid for, and which I paid Comcast to deliver, was virtually unusable, simply because Netflix was not paying my ISP for the ability to deliver its traffic. This is exactly the sort of customer-hostile behavior that is likely to become far more prevalent without net neutrality protections.

Even under Title II, ISPs were permitted to employ ""reasonable network management"" to their networks. This already allowed for things like critical time-sensitive medical or public safety traffic to be prioritized over other traffic, without any money changing hands.

Exhorbitant Pricing
-------------------
If my ISP decided to increase my bill by 500% overnight, I would have no choice but to pay. After all, internet is about as crucial to my life as running water, and I have no competitors I can switch to. Title II protections allowed the FCC to intervene in cases of exhorbitant billing practices. I am not referring to the establishment of price controls on internet service, but simply the FCC having the authority to investigate and stop price gouging.

Privacy
-------
My professional, social, and personal life is conducted primarily through internet communications. This makes my internet traffic some of the most private and personal information I have. I want ISPs to be required to respect the privacy of their customers and not to monitor their personal web history or to sell it to others for marketing purposes. Since I have no confidence in my ISP doing this, and there are [numerous](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/atts-plan-to-watch-your-web-browsing-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/3/) [examples](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/want-verizon-rewards-just-let-vendors-and-partners-see-your-browsing-history/) of internet service providers collecting and monetizing customer browsing history, I want the FCC to have the authority to investigate and punish ISPs who do not respect the privacy of their customers.

The Final Word

  Most Americans only have one choice for true high speed Internet access: our local cable company. Cable companies (and wireless carriers) are actively lobbying Congress and the FCC for the power to:

  * Block sites and apps, to charge them ""access fees""
  * Slow sites and apps to a crawl, to establish paid ""fast lanes"" (normal speed) and slow lanes (artificially low speeds)
  * Impose arbitrarily low data caps, so they can charge sites to escape those caps, or privilege their own services (""zero rating"")

  They're doing it so they can use their monopoly power to stand between me and the sites I want to access, extorting money from us both. I'll be forced to pay more to access the sites I want, and sites will have to pay a kind of protection money to every major cable company or wireless carrier—just to continue working properly! The FCC's Open Internet Rules are the only thing standing in their way.

  I'm sending this to letter to my two senators, my representative, the White House, and the FCC. First, to the FCC: don’t interfere with my ability to access what I want on the Internet, or with websites' ability to reach me. You should leave the existing rules in place, and enforce them.

  To my senators: you have the power to stop FCC Chair Ajit Pai from abusing the rules by refusing to vote for his reconfirmation. I expect you to use that power. Pai, a former Verizon employee, has made it clear he intends to gut the rules to please his former employer and other major carriers, despite overwhelming support for the rules from voters in both parties. I urge you publicly oppose Pai's confirmation on these grounds.

  To the White House: Ajit Pai, a former Verizon employee, is acting in the interests of his former employer, not the American people. America deserves better. Appoint an FCC Chair who will protect the economic miracle that is the Internet from media monopolies like AT&T, Time Warner Cable, and Comcast/NBC/Universal.

  To my representative: please publicly oppose Ajit Pai's plan to oppose the rules, and do everything you can to persuade the Senate and the White House to oppose Pai's nomination.

The internet is far too important a part of my life to allow ISP to slow, block, or control access to any part of the internet. The internet is an essential common carrier in today's world, much like the telephone was been the common carrier rules were established. It is essential that net neutrality be preserved for the preservation of the internet, and indirectly for the preservation of the US economy. Only a few large ISPs would be helped by eliminating net neutrality. A very large number of small and medium sized businesses (including some that I depend upon) could be very seriously damaged by eliminating net neutrality as a false claim of ""internet freedom"". True internet freedom is only available if the internet is regulated as a common carrier. Phone companies are not allowed to determine whom you call; ISPs should not be allowed to determine which web services and web sites you access, nor the speed with which you access them.

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to hand the telecom giants like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast the authority to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the necessary access and privacy safeguards we fought for and so recently won. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the current FCC regulations ensure that Internet providers can’t slow or block customers’ access to certain web services or engage in data discrimination by charging websites and online services money to reach people faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits small businesses and Internet users as well as entrenched Internet companies. Pai’s proposed repeal of the rules would transform Internet providers into Internet gatekeepers with an effective veto right on expression and innovation. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.

The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 

The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.

Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.

Thank you!

The FCC should reject Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to give the telecom giants like AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon free rein to engage in data discrimination, stripping Internet users of the meaningful access and privacy rules we demanded and won just two years ago. 

I’m concerned about ISPs being allowed to discriminate against certain types of data or websites because users will have fewer options and a less diverse Internet. Thankfully, the existing net neutrality rules ensure that ISP monopolies can’t block or slow customers’ access to certain websites or create Internet “fast lanes” by charging online services and websites more money to reach consumers faster. That’s exactly the right balance to ensure the Internet remains a level playing field that benefits Internet users and small businesses as well as larger players. Pai’s proposal would transform ISPs into gatekeepers with an effective veto right on innovation and expression. That’s contrary to the basic precepts on which the Internet was built. 

I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it. 
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.
Please leave the existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
Thank you!
