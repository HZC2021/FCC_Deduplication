Internet providers already nearly have a monopoly on certain market - in the area where I live, for example, there are really only one or two options for high-speed Internet service. From the time of the railroads, monopolies have always used their power to enrich themselves, and given precedence to their own interests. 

ISPs have become a type of ""common carrier"" of our digital information. One of the benefits of this is that they are not responsible for the information they transmit (so they cannot be prosecuted for the transmission of illicit materials, for example), but in exchange the government has always had the responsibility of making sure that they give everyone a level playing field by treating all traffic equally. I don't understand why a government agency, charged with regulating interstate and international communications, would consider stripping the rules that lubricate the continued transmission of information. 

I hope you will consider keeping rules in place that support net neutrality, requiring all traffic on the Internet to be treated equally. In fact, I hope that you will go beyond that and support bringing the United States into the modern era of communications by encouraging or requiring high-speed optical cable from our companies, something common in South Korea and other highly developed nations, as well as other improvements to our infrastructure and current system.

27,1855091,7377167,"Chairman Pai’s proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai’s pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s proposed rules.

Not only is this extremely unfair to consumers and to contributors on the internet, it's completely immoral and only benefits ISPs by bringing them more unfair profits that are ill-deserved.

Why not spend all of our energy making this country great like this supposed Administration was supposed to do, instead of creating legislation that will harm Americans?

The only reason I see this up for debate is the amount of lobbying Comcast, AT&T, and Friends have done to let them control the consumer and hold them hostage unless they fork up more money. Are you really going to let that happen? It doesn't affect just me and every other Average Joe out there, it affects EVERYONE, including you.

As I am sure the commission is well aware, Comcast is consistently ranked among the very bottom performers in customer satisfaction across all consumer industries year after year, yet they are the nation's largest ISP.  I think that demonstrates more clearly than anything else could that there is not adequate competition in this space to ensure consumers' interests without strong regulation.

ISPs may compete with one another over territory, but there is very little real competition for individual customers within those territories, and this is why ISPs feel emboldened to enact anti-consumer policies without fear of losing customers to their competitors.

The internet is a tool deeply embedded in the fabric of all aspects of life today, and by allowing Internet service providers the ability to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.



Do you think America should remain a power in intelligence and communication on the world stage? well keep the internet free from censorship by ISPs



Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small. All I see are businesses looking to squeeze another dime from any corner that they can.

We are a country of equality, and we seem to be forgetting that lately. Stripping away access to certain parts of the internet, or allowing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to throttle or block their services to their consumers is tantamount to segregation. The reasons are different, but the behavior is the same. Certain groups of people under the majority of large ISPs will be shut out from content that others will otherwise have the freedom to access. Therefore, Group B does not have equal access to services that Group A does. Sound familiar?

I'm not trying to sound like the focus here is not net neutrality. I'm just trying to remind us, the people and the government, that this country is supposed to be a role model to other countries and a beacon of hope to people all over the world. We should be leading others and be creating a free world-- not following the actions of other government-restricted countries. We are already starting to be looked down upon by other countries because of some of our decisions in the past couple decades. Our president wants to ""Make America great again."" Repealing the rules on net neutrality is a step towards the wrong direction. This is our chance to start a great change for the better. 

Not only would keeping an open internet help prove this country and its citizens are free, but repealing net neutrality would also hurt businesses, the economy, and the consumers that are being restricted from accessing all content. If ISPs were given control over what their consumers could see and access, then they could easily be bought out or sponsored by companies that pay the ISPs to ""advertise"" their content. ISPs would essentially be given a large amount of power and control over the market. We are already charged for access to the internet by most ISPs. Then the consumers are charged even more just for higher speeds that may be necessary for everyday services. Some of the prices for these necessary services are completely unreasonable just because some ISPs monopolize a city or region (though that's a problem for another day). If ISPs were given this type of control over the internet that we can access, then the vast majority of it may become unattainable to everyone below the top 1% or wherever the line is drawn before ISPs' greed are satiated. These are businesses that the government is talking about giving control over to. They aren't nearly as concerned with customer satisfaction as they are with squeezing out every penny that they can get. However, that kind of profit can only be short-term. Dissatisfied customers will always protest and cause more trouble than this greed is worth resulting in a worst economic state than internet services already are.

Let's learn from the past: in my career as a librarian at a major university, I watched hundreds of science and technology publishers and distributors driven out of business as they were bought up, driven out, or consolidated into just FIVE major international conglomerates.  Now, mostly non-U.S. conglomerates control what gets published in almost all U.S. and European science, math, and technology journals.  That process took about 10 years or so.  Price-gouging rose to obscene levels.  Journals in chemistry and physics went from $250. a year to over $40,000. a year.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai's pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC's proposed rules.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding and to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II and microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

The FCC actions under Chairman Pai SEVERELY undermine the openness and accessibility of the internet by allowing ISPs to bot throttle speed or charge competitive businesses extra for bandwidth.  This creates an anti competitive, monopolistic environment that harms consumer consumption and new innovative business.

Furthermore, Paragraph 82 asks for input on whether throttling should be regulated. In the past ISPs have throttled content based on their own determination of what was lawful or permissible, and had to be forced to stop in the courts. Isn’t it possible they could do this again? I’m also concerned by mobile providers who say a plan is “unlimited,” but when you exceed the data cap, only throttle sites and services that aren’t part of their approved zero-rating network.

I fully support Net Neutrality and the FCC's role in protecting internet user's privacy, the protection from the blocking of specific services and the protection from speed throttling or ""prioritization"" and other issues. I am currently being affected by speed throttling as my home internet is sadly through Verizon's cellular network. 

As you may have guessed, I currently don't have options for ISPs that are available where I live. For more than 10 years I have requested that the closest ISP company (and only company) to expand to my residence. The company's name is Mid-Hudson Cable and until recently it was always ""No"" or I could but I would have to pay for everything which was a few thousands dollars. That cost would be only to expand to my house and then I would have to pay to use the service itself. They didn't see any profit in offering me their service, but recently and thankfully New York State has granted ISPs a huge amount of funds to expand to rural areas that have no service. According to the state, everyone in New York will have broadband internet service available to them before 2018.

So I should have their service fairly soon. If I don't have Net Neutrality and the FCC to protect me then Mid-Hudson Cable could technically charge me double, triple or an even more exorbitant amount, they could and they know they can because they have no other competing company in the area for me to choose from. Without the FCC and Net Neutrality I would literally be at the whim of an ISP that had no oversight or limitation imposed on them. It is very important that the FCC understand this and why this is a MAJOR concern for ISP customers, especially for those with only one ISP available to them.

As of now the only way I am able to have ""fast enough"" internet service is via Verizon's cellular network at 4G speeds. It costs me approx. $130 a month for speeds that vary but are nowhere near what the FCC has labeled as ""Broadband"", often as slow as 0.5 mb/s. I am currently concerned that my speeds are being throttled due to my internet usage as Verizon can track individuals and how much they use. It took a lot of research to even figure out a way to provide myself with internet in a non traditional sense and quite a bit of money to pay for the equipment needed to use the service as my home internet. People like me should have normal FCC regulated ISPs available to them, we shouldn't have to fight and find a way to get a decent internet service, especially one that is throttled, overpriced and unreliable. 

Through my experiences as an internet user and consumer I believe that Net Neutrality should be upheld by the law and continue to be regulated and overseen by the FCC. Without Net Neutrality ISPs will have no limitations on what they can impose on their customers. It is a service which is needed and crucial in modern society, this cannot be argued, not anymore. I believe that every citizen should have multiple ISPs competing to be their provider in their area without price gouging, service blocking, service throttling fraudulent billing or what is now known as paid prioritization. ISPs are continually expanding to areas without, and as they do these customers (such as myself) will need the protection now more than ever. 

I hope that this information is used and considered in FCC proceedings in support for Net Neutrality and the importance of the FCCs regulatory and overseeing role of ISPs, thank you.",-1.0

I don't want ISPs to have the power to block websites, slow them down, give some sites an advantage over others, or split the Internet into ""fast lanes"" for companies that pay and ""slow lanes"" for the rest.

Censorship by ISPs is a serious problem. Comcast has throttled Netflix, AT&T blocked FaceTime, Time Warner Cable throttled the popular game League of Legends, and Verizon admitted it will introduce fast lanes for sites that pay-and slow lanes for everyone else-if the FCC lifts the rules. This hurts consumers and businesses large and small.

Courts have made clear that if the FCC ends Title II classification, the FCC must let ISPs offer ""fast lanes"" to websites for a fee.

Chairman Pai has made clear that he intends to do exactly this.

But if some companies can pay our ISPs to have their content load faster, startups and small businesses that can't pay those fees won't be able to compete. You will kill the open marketplace that has enabled millions of small businesses and created the 5 most valuable companies in America-just to further enrich a few much less valuable cable giants famous for sky-high prices and abysmal customer service.

Internet providers will be able to impose a private tax on every sector of the American economy.

Moreover, under Chairman Pai's plan, ISPs will be able to make it more difficult to access political speech that they don't like. They'll be able to charge fees for website delivery that would make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can't pay up to have their voices heard.

Chairman Pai’s proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai’s pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s proposed rules.

I'm sending this to the FCC's open proceeding and to my members of Congress. Please publicly support the FCC's existing net neutrality rules based on Title II and microbusinesses like mine.

1498,1619616,4973580,"Dear Leaders of the FCC,
 
I am writing this letter to you today, because as a AP computer sciences student, we talked about the ever growing topic of Net Neutrality. Seeing this foreign topic, I had no priorr knowledge on what Net Neutrality actually was. After a bit of research, I finally have my own stance on the subject and wanted to share my thoughts with you about it because, there have been a lot of formalities regarding the issue with people agreeing and disagreeing with it. I’d say as personal standpoint I support Rob Wittman's argument to restoring internet freedom. I do think that Net Neutrality is essential and applicable to keeping the freedom that comes with the internet. I think people all over the world should have access to a free and open internet where their privacy is protected. Without it, he suppliers will call the tune, they can  restrict access to their fee based sites, add surcharges, making streaming of content without their adverts impractical and overall ruin how the internet was meant to operate as it was originally intended. 
 
I am in favor of Net Neutrality, because in the long run I think it will ultimately make good business sense. However, there is still the issue of the importance of access to the internet and information that people uses their internet provider lines to download insane amounts of bytes of software, movies, music and games illegally through pirated software like torrents. While this is an issue with people like these; big providers shouldn't get special treatment like more bandwidth and faster speed, because it’ll tear down little start-ups, because they’ll be at a disadvantage. We live in a capitalist society, because we have the rights to invoke competition. With regulations like these, there's no room for competition  between big parties. It also ultimately doesn't fix the issue, because people will still find ways around the structure to get the things they want. Giving special treatment isn't fixing problems like these; more like delaying the inevitable.
 
Overall, I can see why people disagree with the cause and effects, net neutrality will bring and they do make clear and valid points. This debate is a debate because there is no clear winner and more of coming up with a  new perspective that all parties can agree on. I'm glad, the FCC and people Rob Wittman try and work to ensure that Americans have access to a free and open internet where their privacy is protected. Thank you for giving your time to read my letter.
 
Sincerely,
Donte Payne",-1.0

Chairman Pai’s proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai’s pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC’s proposed rules.

Chairman Pai's proposed plan to repeal net neutrality protections would put a huge burden on microbusinesses like mine.

As an Etsy seller, net neutrality is essential to the success of my business and my ability to care for myself and my family. The FCC needs to ensure equal opportunities for microbusinesses to compete with larger and more established brands by upholding net neutrality protections.

Etsy has opened the door for me and 1.8 million other sellers to turn our passion into a business by connecting us to a global market of buyers. For 32% of creative entrepreneurs on the platform, our creative business is our sole occupation. A decrease in sales in the internet slow lane or higher cost to participate in Chairman Pai's pay-to-play environment would create significant obstacles for me and other Etsy sellers to care for ourselves and our families.

Moreover, 87% of Etsy sellers in the U.S. are women, and most run their microbusinesses out of their homes. By rolling back the bright line rules that ensure net neutrality, Chairman Pai is not only taking away our livelihood, he is also putting up barriers to entrepreneurship for a whole cohort of Americans.

My business growth depends on equal access to consumers. Any rule that allows broadband providers to negotiate special deals with some companies would undermine my ability to compete online.

We need a free and open internet that works for everyone, not just telecom companies that stand to benefit from the FCC's proposed rules.

2104,2091966,7859178,"I have been a computer and Internet user for most of my life, beginning in 1993 using a 486 computer over dial up access.  The internet opened doors and gave me access to information and media far beyond the library and my teachers, which increased my knowledge and understanding of the world outside of the United States.  When ADSL was offered in Atlanta we were early adopters, suffering a six month back and forth with AT&T. We re-wired our home and purchased very expensive equipment, all for the sake of greater access to a vast and diverse collection of information and media of my choosing.

I have watched cable/media companies, such as Time Warner, Cox and Comcast enter into the ISP business, which has traditionally been the realm of telecom companies.  At the same time, telecom companies such as Verizon and AT&T have entered into the media distribution fields.  Both the telecom and the cable/media industries are finding their traditional products less and less appealing as people move to a more consumer oriented model of media consumption and communication.  On the media side I am referring to YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and the many similar products that allow consumers to choose what to watch and when from a nearly limitless catalog.  On the telecom side the advent of VOIP has nearly eliminated the need for business phone lines, due to the tremendous cost savings over traditional ISDN and T1 phone service.  individuals have opted for mobile phones, which is outside the scope of this proceeding but a pressure on the telecoms companies traditional business as well.  The telecoms and cable/media companies share a common product, internet access, which allow consumers to move away from their traditional offerings.  

This common product, internet service, is what the consumer wishes to purchase and use.  The current model is to sell a tier of service based on bandwidth which the customer may use at will for any purpose, within the law.  I fail to see any benefit to the customer in allowing the largest ISPs in the country to intentionally degrade service to customers.  It absolutely allows an ISP to charge customers or providers more so that a certain service works correctly, or to drive customers to consuming media owned and monetized by the ISP(most of whom are also content companies).  That sounds  like the classic organized crime racket of ""protection money"".  The claim that throttling online media services reduces network congestion is also a spurious one.  If there is not enough available bandwidth on their networks an investment needs to be made, or suffer the consequences of a competitor who is willing to provide a superior product entering the marketplace.

In closing, I urge the FCC to leave the 2015 ruling in place.  The current ruling is most in line with our market economy as it fosters competition and requires ISPs to compete for customer business based on performance.

2250,2424809,10088187,"I am writing to express my objections to roll back decisions and rules that currently regulate broadband internet providers as public utilities.  The proposed alternative, to re-classify ISPs as private mobile networks and regulate them through the light-touch framework, will not significantly increase infrastructure investment and certainly will not improve innovation and choice.  Nor would it substantially benefit consumers and the marketplace, except for the large communication monopolies.  The communication companies have written and supported the government rules that guarantee them a field of play that is the antithesis of free market capitalism:  little competition and restricting the public's access to information.

I believe that the discussion should focus on (1) equality and freedom consistent with the republic’s democratic goals and (2) promoting of innovation that will drive our economy and society forward.

Information is knowledge and equal access to information is essential. Internet access plays a fundamental role in the nation’s equality. We spend increasingly more of our commercial, political and social lives online, and our communications can reach across the world in microseconds. Our governments use the Internet and social media to manage civic affairs. We communicate with our government through the Internet. When one’s access is restricted, their role is restricted; their ability to participate in our society is restricted. This is why open Internet matters. It’s as essential to modern life as electricity and water.  I believe that this country supports equality, not a digital version of “separate but equal” where citizens are able to participate only depending on their wealth.

The Internet’s story is a story of innovation.  We have Google, Facebook, and Amazon exactly because there was a level playing field.  Protecting the ISPs should not be the focus of our public policy. What we need are policies that protect the companies that haven’t been invented - or even imagined - by letting them have a genuinely level playing field.  Equality promotes innovation!

The FCC needs to ensure that money won’t drown out other voices. Our policies need to be rooted in the ideas of freedom and fair competition.  The FCC needs to preserve both freedom and equality, where there are not any fast or slow lanes on the Internet and where all traffic flows freely. Everyone - individuals, groups, large firms, tiny start-ups - must be treated the same way.

Please make do not adopt the proposed rules of “Restoring Internet Freedom” because they do anything but restore freedom.  Instead keep the exiting rules in place and continue to regulate ISPs as public utilities.

Net Neutrality is something that there is no reason to not have -what do we stand to gain by removing Net Neutrality? It won't be any easier or cheaper to do things.

I am a recent graduate of University of Kansas School of Business and have been working in the Audit industry for over 3 years.  The biggest asset in both my academic life and my professional life has been my open access to the Internet.  The open internet which was protected by the previous Net Neutrality laws have also increased my trust in our e-commerce.  Consumers should have equal access to all services and products provided on the Internet; options shouldn't be limited or intentionally-manipulated.  For these reasons and more, I OPPOSE the Chairman's proposal to reverse net neutrality protections and do not agree that the access to services and businesses on the internet should be at the discretion of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

My constant use of the internet in college has fine-tuned my ability to research subjects and problem-solve in new ways.  As a Business student, many of our projects focused on innovation and the benefits of equal opportunity in the market-place.  Time after time the students and I came across innovative entrepreneurs who benefited from Net Neutrality laws (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc.).  Handing the power to dictate the internet-traffic-flow would not have benefited these companies.  Netflix is an example of innovation in the Video-Rental market which then spurred their competitor, Hulu.  My favorite part of this example is how Amazon adapted their existing infrastructure to ""make their mark"" in the video-streaming market as well.

I continue to use the internet to research subjects relevant to my job.  As an IT Auditor I come across products, vendors, SEC Regulations that are relevant to the execution of a Financial Audit.  I depend on having access to the best search-engine when I access the internet and I place a certain amount of trust in the choices I make.  A recent example of this is the litigation Google is facing by the EU.  Google was found to be intentionally-manipulate the results of consumer-searches which in-turn limited the choices a consumer had in the internet marketplace.  This has decreased my trust in Google as a provided of fair search results.  The same concept applies here with ISPs and my trust in the open internet.

2517,1742161,7076367,"Entrepreneurship requires opportunity. Rolling back Net Neutrality, by definition, places roadblocks in the path of those who cannot afford to compete with the extant commercial giants and creates an unlevel playing field in which new players simply cannot compete.

I would rather see tax breaks for ISP's as an incentive to maintain Net Neutrality than create a bidding war over access to consumers.

Keep it simple. Net Neutrality ensures equal access to both consumers and vendors. No additional regulations or enforcement needed. Once you remove that mandate, free trade gets run over by wild west economics, and it will takes years if not decades to get sufficient regulations in place and enforced before anything approaching a fair marketplace could be re-established. Almost 250 years of capitalism have shown that if a system can be abused for profit, there are always those who will find a way to do so. Why open the door to a new flavor of monopolies and tie-ins when we have, as a society, spent the bulk of our history trying to create a fair marketplace that fosters competition?

Don't turn the internet into yet another battlefield for class warfare. Equality is worth fighting for. Keep Net Neutrality.",-1.0
